The limits for 2024 are higher than those for 2023 ($22,500) because the IRS adjusts them for inflation and cost of living increases every year.

Unlike a Roth IRA, designated-Roth contributions within a 401(k) are not subject to an income threshold. But, as with a Roth IRA, qualified withdrawals (including both contributions and earnings) are not taxed.</p><h2 id=employer-contributions>Employer contributions</h2><p>Employers must calculate their contributions based on compensation of $345,000 or less and are subject to a limit of $69,000 ($76,500 if you are 50 or older) minus your contributions. If you have any allocated forfeitures or nondeductible contributions, they must also be subtracted from the maximum total.</p><h2 id=401k-contribution-limits-when-you-have-multiple-401k-plans-at-different-employers>401(k) contribution limits when you have multiple 401(k) plans at different employers</h2><p>Your annual personal contribution limit for 2024 of $23,000 or $30,500 applies to all 401(k) accounts.

However, the IRS requires companies to perform three nondiscrimination tests each year to prevent HCEs or key employees from gaining more benefit from the company's 401(k) plan than non-HCEs.</p><li><a rel=nofollow href=#>ADP test</a>.

These refunds will be subject to taxation and are no longer a part of the HCE’s 401(k) plan. To prevent the need for correction, some companies conduct mid-year ADP/ACP test projections to allow HCEs to adjust their contributions.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>When a plan fails the top-heavy test</a>, the employer has to contribute up to 3% of salary for all non-key employees as of the last day of the plan year.

Further, any earnings on those contributions must also be returned. You will need to include the excess contributions in your gross income and pay taxes on that amount, as well as on the earnings, on your 2024 tax year return. Excess Roth contributions are not subject to taxation, but earnings are.</p><p>If you fail to obtain your excess contributions and earnings by April 15, you will be subject to double taxation—once on your 2024 return and again on your 2025 return.

And, unlike with a Roth 401(k) plan, earnings on after-tax 401(k), non-Roth contributions are taxable upon withdrawal.</p><h2 id=how-much-should-you-contribute-to-your-401k>How much should you contribute to your 401(k)?</h2><p>First of all, if you can, you should contribute enough to your 401(k) to take advantage of the full amount of your employer match if there is one. Additionally, experts generally recommend that you contribute between 10% and 15% of your income each year. After that, it’s a matter of where you can get the most bang for your retirement-savings buck. This could include your 401(k), traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and even taxable investment accounts. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Playbook</a> can provide insights on how to leverage tax-advantaged accounts like these for retirement.</p><h3 class=product-title>Playbook</h3><p>Why Playbook?</p><p>Playbook empowers high earners to optimize returns through strategic tax planning, crafting a financial plan and routing your funds into the most advantageous accounts.</p><p>Fees</p><p>Free trial: 7 days</p><p>Essential: $19/month (best for assets under $29K)</p><p>Plus: $59/month (best for assets over $29K)</p><h2 id=how-to-maximize-your-401k-contributions>How to maximize your 401(k) contributions</h2><p>Here are some easy strategies you can employ to help maximize your personal 401(k) contributions.</p><p>Increase your savings rate. The default savings rate for many 401(k) plans is 3%, but you are free to set your own savings rate (within the IRS deferral limits, of course) and increase it as you are able.</p><p>Take advantage of employer matching. Many employers match your contributions up to a certain amount or a certain percentage. Find out your employer match and make sure you get every dime of this “free money.”</p><p>Don’t quit before you are vested. Your employer match likely comes with some strings attached in the form of a requirement that you have to be with the company for a certain number of years before you get to keep the employer match. Make sure you know the rules and take them into account when you plan career moves.</p><p>Take the savers tax credit. In addition to your pre-tax contributions to your 401(k) that reduce taxable income, <a rel=nofollow href=#>you may qualify for an additional tax credit</a> of $1,000 for individuals or $2,000 for couples, representing 50% of a maximum contribution of $2,000 or $4,000, respectively. To qualify for the full 50% (the credit phases out based on income), <a rel=nofollow href=#>in 2024</a>, your adjusted gross income (AGI) must be $46,000 or less if filing jointly or $23,000 or less if filing as a single person. Lower tax credits are available on a sliding scale for incomes up to $76,500 for married filing jointly and $38,250 for singles.</p><p>Add a designated-Roth 401(k). Ask whether your employer offers a Roth 401(k) or allows non-Roth after-tax contributions. Either one can help increase your savings, and non-Roth after-tax contributions are not tied to your personal ($23,000/$30,500) limit. Depending on your company’s plan, you may be able to split your contribution between the two types of 401(k)s.</p><p>Know where your 401(k) accounts are. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Beagle</a>, a company that specializes in finding lost 401(k) accounts, suggests starting by contacting former employers to find lost accounts. Check old 401(k) statements to locate the company HR department. There are “unclaimed assets” databases that might also hold clues. Of course, use your Social Security number cautiously when doing this research.</p><h2 id=other-ways-to-save-for-retirement>Other ways to save for retirement</h2><p>When calculating retirement income, don’t forget to include Social Security benefits and any pensions for which you qualify. Then consider other avenues in addition to your workplace 401(k) that can increase your retirement portfolio amount.</p><p><strong>Financial advisor</strong>. You can set strategies and get help with retirement planning with services such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>Empower</a>, which offer both a financial planning platform and dedicated financial advisors.</p><h3 class=product-title>Empower Financial Advisor</h3><p>Minimum to open</p><p>$0</p><p>Fees</p><p>Managed accounts accrue an annual fee that’s charged quarterly and based on your assets under management (AUM). The rates are 0.50% for up to $100,000 in AUM, 0.40% for the next $150,000, 0.30% for the next $150,000, and then 0.20% for AUM greater than $400,000.</p><p><strong>Individual retirement account (IRA)</strong>. There are two main types of IRAs—<a rel=alternate href=#>traditional and Roth</a>. Both offer tax advantages. Best of all, the 2024 IRA contribution limits ($7,000/$8,000 for those age 50 and over) are in addition to those of a 401(k).</p><p><strong>Health savings account (HSA)</strong>. One under-utilized savings plan is the HSA, which can be used to help pay healthcare expenses in retirement. HSA contributions are tax-deductible and withdrawals are tax-free if the money is used for healthcare expenses. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Limits for 2024</a> are $4,150 for individuals, $8,300 for families, with a $1,000 catch-up amount for people age 55 or older. (Note that in order to contribute to this account you need a <a rel=nofollow href=#>high deductible health plan</a>, which may not be suitable for everyone.)</p><p><strong>Taxable investment account</strong>. It’s always possible to invest post-tax funds after you’ve exhausted your tax-advantaged savings options. This can include a brokerage account, which offers no tax advantages or tax-free growth, but does open up many more investing opportunities than most 401(k) and IRA plans.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel=alternate href=#>Best Online Brokers</a></strong></p><p><strong>Tax deferred annuities</strong>. <a rel=alternate href=#>Insurance company annuities</a> offer tax deferral and investment options and a set payout for a number of years or even for life. There is no limit to the amount you can invest in an annuity.</p><p><strong>Real estate</strong>. <a rel=alternate href=#>Opportunities range</a> from real estate investment trusts (REITS) to rental housing.

For 2024, your personal contributions cannot exceed $23,000 or $30,500 if you are age 50 or older. Other limits also apply, including the amount your employer can contribute.</p><p>What makes 401(k) plans especially attractive is that your employer can match your contributions (up to set limits). Taking advantage of this “free money” is a no-brainer for most people. If you max out your 401(k) contributions—or just the amount that can be matched—explore other options to help you reach your total savings goal.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Did 401(k) limits increase in 2024?</h3><p>Yes. Personal contribution limits for 401(k) plans increased in 2024 to $23,000—up $500 from $22,500 in 2023—for people under age 50. If you are 50 or older, your personal contribution limit is $30,500—the catchup contribution remains at $1,000, same as last year.</p><h3>If I have a 401(k), can I receive a Saver’s Tax Credit?</h3><p>Possibly. The saver's tax credit is available to income-eligible taxpayers who contribute to employer-sponsored 401(k), 403(b), and certain other retirement savings plans. In order to get the full 50% tax credit for 2024, a single tax filer must have an AGI of $23,000 or less, while joint filers must have income of $46,000 or less.</p><h3>Does the 401k contribution limit include an employer match?</h3><p>Your personal contribution limit does not include employer matching. There is an all-sources limit that does include all contributions you make and any employer contributions made to your 401(k) account. In 2024, the all-sources limit is $69,000 for those under age 50, and $76,500 for those age 50 and over.</p><p>TIME Stamped is paid a flat fee for each successful referral to Herring RIA Sub, LLC ("Playbook") made through our links.
