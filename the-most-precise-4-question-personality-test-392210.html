<time>14 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The Myers-Briggs</strong> <strong>Type Indicator</strong> was created during World War II&nbsp;to&nbsp;help women get jobs and replace the men who had left to&nbsp;fight. After answering several questions, they got a&nbsp;short report, according to&nbsp;which they could find the most effective work.</p><p>Some Western companies still use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator when selecting candidates for their vacancies.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>created a&nbsp;short version of&nbsp;this test with only 4&nbsp;questions and 2&nbsp;answer options to&nbsp;each. That’s it! The combination of&nbsp;letters will tell you about your personality type.</p><p><h2><strong>1. You are totally exhausted because your week was endless and less than great. How are you going to&nbsp;spend your weekend?</strong></h2></p><ul><li>I’ll call my&nbsp;<a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> to&nbsp;ask about their plans. I&nbsp;heard that a&nbsp;new <a href=# title=restaurant data-link=tag>restaurant</a> opened&nbsp;/ a&nbsp;nice <a href=# title=comedy data-link=tag>comedy</a> is&nbsp;playing in&nbsp;the cinemas&nbsp;/ there are big discounts at&nbsp;the paintball club. We&nbsp;should all go&nbsp;out together. <strong>E</strong></li><li>I’ll switch on&nbsp;the "Don’t disturb" mode on&nbsp;my&nbsp;phone and stay at&nbsp;<a href=# title=home data-link=tag>home</a>. I’ll watch a&nbsp;new episode of&nbsp;my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;TV show, do&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=puzzle data-link=tag>puzzle</a>, and take a&nbsp;long bath with a&nbsp;book. <strong>I</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a46/f74/19e1535223bc8f67283e31df16.jpg><p>Once the weekend hits, I do not want to be disturbed. I don't want to even talk on the phone, I turn my ringer off. I don't want to go to parties, nor do I want to do things with others. I just want to be left alone. I'm definitely "Introverted" when my energy is low, I hide. Being around others is exhausting.</p><p><h2><strong>2. Which of&nbsp;these 2&nbsp;descriptions suits you more?</strong></h2></p><ul><li>The most important thing for me&nbsp;is&nbsp;what’s happening here and now. I&nbsp;assess real situations and pay attention to&nbsp;details. <strong>S</strong></li><li>Facts are boring. I&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> to&nbsp;dream and play over upcoming events in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind. I&nbsp;rely more on&nbsp;<a href=# title=intuition data-link=tag>intuition</a> than information. <strong>N</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/efa/cd7/4337605ef29ee00ad8b9326254.jpg><p>I want to avoid the here and now most of the time it's so taxing.. The every day stuff is boring. I'd rather day-dream about going to the beach when the weather improves, or running barefoot in the rain when it rains... Even when I'm on the beach in the moment... I'm daydreaming about something else because things get boring fast to me. Recently someone was talking to me about politics, all I could do was daydream about getting a delicious ice cream after work.</p><p><h2><strong>3. A&nbsp;competitor of&nbsp;your current employer is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;entice you. You have doubts because the salary is&nbsp;much higher there, but the staff here is&nbsp;great. Moreover, the head of&nbsp;your department hinted that he&nbsp;will recommend you to&nbsp;the bosses when he&nbsp;retires. How are you going to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;decision?</strong></h2></p><ul><li>I’ll learn all the available information about the competitor, ask my&nbsp;HR manager for advice, and draw a&nbsp;chart with all the pros and cons. In&nbsp;such cases, it’s important to&nbsp;weigh up&nbsp;all the arguments and assess the situation with a&nbsp;cold mind. <strong>T</strong></li><li>I’ll listen to&nbsp;my&nbsp;feelings. I&nbsp;always try to&nbsp;follow my&nbsp;heart. <strong>F</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e59/376/d888bc599a8d5dd32a4d0fcbb1.jpg><p>Always "F" - If I'm happy somewhere, and love my job, I don't want to leave to get higher pay and be miserable. I've turned down high paying jobs if I feel I'll hate them.</p><p><h2><strong>4. Only 2&nbsp;weeks are left before your close friends’ wedding. How are the preparations going?</strong></h2></p><ul><li>One month ago, I&nbsp;chose the saxophonist who will play a&nbsp;medley of&nbsp;our school songs&nbsp;/ collected the couple’s photo love story&nbsp;/ composed a&nbsp;poem&nbsp;/ pressed my&nbsp;suit&nbsp;/ made appointments with the stylist and makeup master. I&nbsp;prefer to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fully armed. <strong>J</strong></li><li>Why prepare? I’ll be&nbsp;having fun and enjoying myself at&nbsp;the <a href=# title=party data-link=tag>party</a>. I’ll improvise my&nbsp;<a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> speech. The best things happen spontaneously. <strong>P</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/985/88f/69fa6c51498208e9175f67f71f.jpg><p>I'm INFP "The Healer" - I knew that already but this was fun anyways.</p><p><h2><strong>And now you can find your personality type according to&nbsp;Myers-Briggs!</strong></h2></p><p><h2><strong>ESTJ&nbsp;— MANAGER</strong></h2></p><p>Practical and consistent, you like to&nbsp;have order everywhere by&nbsp;planning and organizing everything.
