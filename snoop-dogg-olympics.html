<time>05 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> has brought humor and fun to the<a href=#> 2024 Olympic Games</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 52-year-old rapper was tapped to contribute as a special correspondent for NBC’s Olympic coverage this year after a clip of him saying a horse was <a href=#>“crip walking</a>” during a 2021 Tokyo Olympic dressage competition went viral online.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year, Snoop has held the Olympic torch, was spotted supporting Olympians—such as <a href=#>tennis star Coco Gauff</a> and two-time all-around Olympic gold-medalist Simone Biles—with pictures of the athletes plastered on his shirts, was seen cheering on Team USA at matches, and even traded a unique Snoop Dogg Olympic pin with those at the Games.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are some of the memorable Olympic moments with the rapper and record producer.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Holding the torch at the Opening Ceremony</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Snoop had a lovely start to the Paris Olympics when he was selected as one of a few cultural icons who got to hold the Olympic torch during the <a href=#>Opening Ceremony</a> of the Olympic Games last week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2162867484.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I felt like Muhammad Ali," Snoop said in an interview with NBC Sports after the ceremony. “I was waving, shaking hands, kissing the babies — doing what I do, you understand me? Putting my foot in the pavement, letting the people know that we're here. We're here for peace, love, unity and great sportsmanship."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Attending an Equestrian Event with Martha Stewart</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Snoop reunited with longtime friend Martha Stewart to attend the Olympic dressage competition on Aug. 3. The two donned full riding attire—including matching helmets and riding coats and celebrated Stewart’s 83rd birthday.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"Snoop called me, and he knows I love horses," <a href=#>Stewart said the day before the event</a>. "He's a little fearful of horses." Snoop added that, despite his fear, he planned on bringing carrots and apples for the winning horse to eat after they compete.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Swimming with Michael Phelps</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The “Drop It Like It’s Hot” rapper took to the swimming pool with the most-decorated Olympian in history, Michael Phelps, in an NBC segment for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Snoop teased Phelps, who said that his secret to being a great swimmer has to do with his wingspan and lung power. “You just described me,” said Snoop. “I definitely have great lung power. And I do have a swimmer’s body…We could be twins.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swimming proved to be much harder than it seems. “Mike, you make this look too easy,” he said after a lap in the pool.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Cheering on Caeleb Dressel</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Snoop Dogg warmed hearts when <a href=#>he supported</a> eight-time Olympic medal winner Caeleb Dressel as he won his latest gold medal during the U.S. men’s 4x100 freestyle relay. Snoop cheered for him alongside Dressel’s wife and son at his side. It was Team USA’s first gold medal in Paris.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The main thing that I really wanted to do was be out in the field dealing with the families so I can see the experience of that support system,” Snoop said in a post-match interview on NBC. “Being there with Caeleb’s wife and his son and his sister-in-law, you could just see that they was missing from the last Olympics and how this one felt so emotional to her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I feel like I’m a part of their family now,” he added.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Dancing with Jordan Chiles and Simone Biles&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The rapper was also spotted watching the Olympic women’s gymnastics team, where he started dancing—with two hands up in the air—while cheering on the young women competing.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Biles</a> spotted Snoop first, pointing at him in the crowd, but Jordan Chiles was the first to dance with him. (Snoop was standing near the Chiles’ family.) Biles soon followed, smiling and waving her hands up and down with Snoop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Snoop’s Olympic pin</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When athletes aren’t training, eating <a href=#>chocolate muffins at the Olympic village</a>, or winning medals, they’re participating in another beloved pastime: pin trading. The practice is well-documented online, as Olympians scramble to get the memento from highly-coveted countries like Belize, who came to Paris with one athlete, and whose pins feature <a href=#>a toucan</a>; or the Netherlands, whose pin is a pair of clogs. Some athletes, like Simone Biles also have their own pin for the Olympic Games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Snoop’s pin was shared by the International Tennis Federation <a href=#>online</a>. It depicts Snoop in a blue suit generating five rings of smoke, colored like the Olympic rings with the Eiffel Tower in the background. Gauff called it the “best pin [she’s] ever gotten,” in a video thanking Snoop.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Snoop’s custom T-shirts</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Snoop has shown his support for Team USA donning custom outfits at the Olympics. He’s been seen wearing shirts with Gauff and Biles on them, but was also at the women’s beach volleyball tournament, where he wore a jacket with Sara Hughes face, which he later zipped down to reveal a shirt with Kelly Cheng’s image.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I represent the USA,” Snoop said. “Do what y’all do baby, bring home the gold.” The pair won their match against the French on Wednesday and will compete again on Friday against Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Snoop meets French Bulldog, Pierre </strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Olympians aren’t the only ones having their dreams come true. Snoop’s wish to meet a French bulldog came true when he was surprised by the beret-bearing four-legged creature.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The rapper affectionately gave the canine the name Pierre Cardin, as seen in a video of the encounter shared by Access Hollywood. “My thing about Pierre, he’s spooned, he’s groomed. He’s dipped and whipped. And he’s suited and booted and gooted and wooted,” Snoop said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Snoop closes out the closing ceremony</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the American-themed portion of the closing ceremony to honor the next Summer Olympics host city Los Angeles, Snoop Dogg was back stateside, performing "Drop It Like It's Hot" on a palm tree lined beach. Dr. Dre joined him for their hit "The Next Episode."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/snoop.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBsfnl9jqylqKegYrGws8ZmpqWxnaW2pL%2BO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsnoop-dogg-olympics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsnoop-dogg-olympics.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-olympics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsnoop-dogg-olympics.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-olympics.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsnoop-dogg-olympics.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./palestinian-child-detainees.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./palestinian-child-detainees.html>I Saw the Haunting Reality of Palestinian Child Prisoners</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./regions-de-france-cnfpt-des-formations-sur-mesure-pour-les-agents-des-regions.html>des formations &amp;quot;sur-mesure&amp;quot; pour les agents des rgions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./regions-de-france-cnfpt-des-formations-sur-mesure-pour-les-agents-des-regions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
