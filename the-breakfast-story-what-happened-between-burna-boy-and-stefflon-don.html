I was in Africa for a show then I missed my flight, he had a show where he performed and I went to the show and the rest is history baby. He told me I was going to be his wife and you know how boys always talk s***, but I didn’t remember he said that but he told me and I was like wow.”</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>The relationship</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A series of Instagram posts from the couple in February 2019 revealed their relationship was official.

I’m trying to make it right because I don’t want to bring a kid into this life and everyone is disturbing the kid, wondering what Stefflon Don and Burna Boy’s kids are doing. I want to raise a kid the way I was raised.”</p><p>August 2019: The cheating allegations began. It was reported that he was seeing a Ghanaian actress,<strong> Princess Shyngle.</strong></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-dd41f097-1d5f-4375-bc30-affdcd687e3d data-caption="Stefflon Don, Burna Boy and Princess Shyngle"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/DWektkpTURBXy8zMjk0NjMwYjE1OTIwMWRlZDMwZjI0OTcwMDFhMjZkZS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAb3Cww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>November 2019: Burna Boy let everyone know that their relationship was fine, he unfollowed everyone on Instagram but Steff.</p><p>All seemed well for a while and they were even talking of an engagement and marriage in June 2020.</p><p>However, in October 2020, eyes and lurkers noticed that they had <a href=# id=f33af5d7-9846-402e-8015-bd38bb2bdb64>unfollowed</a> each other. Was that the final hit?</p><p>In December 2020, More trouble lurked when <a href=# id=65cea2d5-efd4-44d3-b639-8a181e55085f>Jo Pearl, </a>his ex and an Instagram model in the United Kingdom, came out to say that she was in a relationship with Burna Boy even before he met Steff.</p><p>Steff, at that time, even tweeted in support of her man. She said, "What in the Nollywood is going on here, mate?"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Bro, it has really taken everything in me to keep quiet but the audacity of this woman to call me a 'Nollywood actress' whilst begging for answers and evidence in my DMs will forever leave me gobsmacked,” wrote Jo Pearl.</p><p>But nothing lasts forever, and last last everybody go chop breakfast. Their last sighting together was on his 30th birthday in July 2021.</p><p>Sometime in December 2021, Burna Boy wrote in his story, “Odogwu no get wife.”</p><p>She tweeted in return, "No matter how much love, loyalty or how good you treat someone, people are just not solid and scream real but are the fakest. Fame & money changes some ppl. When people show you who they are believe them. As hard as that may be. God sees and knows. People genuinely need prayers".</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>The Aftermath</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The interesting thing about this couple is that their breakup is much more interesting than their relationship.
