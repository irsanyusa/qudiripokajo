<time>15 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Police identified her as 34-year-old astrology influencer, <strong>Danielle Ayoka</strong>, whose legal name is <strong>Danielle Cherakiyah Johnson</strong>.</p><p>Based on what investigators told the press, police believe Ayoka stabbed her partner early Monday morning, then got into a car with her two daughters and pushed them out of the moving vehicle before hitting a tree herself.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>Danielle Ayoka and her family were found on the day of the solar eclipse</h2></p><p>Approximately at 4:30 am, police found an 8-month-old baby in the middle of Highway 405. Officers also found an injured 9-year-old girl on the side of the road. Half an hour later, Ayoka was found 10 miles away in the driver's seat of a black SUV. She died on the spot as a result of hitting a tree.</p><p>Two hours later, a neighbour who had heard Ayoka and her partner arguing the night before called 911 after seeing blood in the hallway and elevator of their Woodland Hills apartment building.</p><p>According to a neighbour, telephone paramedics sent him inside, where he found 29-year-old <strong>Jaelen Allen Chaney</strong> stabbed in the kitchen. According to the Los Angeles Times, police later found tarot cards and black feathers in the apartment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Investigators were supposed to determine the course of events after talking to Ayoka and Chaney's 9-year-old daughter, who survived the incident. According to their accounts, Ayoka stabbed her partner early Monday morning while he was lying on the couch. She tried to drag his body out of the apartment building, but ended up leaving it in the kitchen.</p><p>She then drove the car out of the complex with her two children, and when she reached the 405 freeway, she slowed down and told her older daughter to get out. When the 9-year-old, who was holding her younger sister in her arms, refused, Ayoka allegedly pushed her from the moving vehicle in the middle of the highway.</p><p>Ayoka was later seen driving on the Pacific Coast Highway at speed of over 100 miles per hour. Police found her crashed car near Vincent Street. The officers managed to identify the influencer despite extensive injuries on her body. They pronounced the astrologer dead on the spot.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Who was Danielle Ayoka?</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-85b42051-9790-4c9a-8da4-b10db3d190e7 data-caption="Ayoka gained thousands of followers on social media thanks to her astrological advice [The Fader]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/kRtktkpTURBXy9kMWYyNWM4MDcyOWU0NzAxYzhhZTIwYjkxNDM2ZDNmYi5qcGeSlQMAAM0B1M0CTJUCzQHUzQJMwsM></span><p>Ayoka, known on X as an "astrologer" and "qualified reiki teacher," had been posting under the pseudonym MysticxLipstick since around 2015. She described zodiac signs, posted astrology advice, and offered paid healing and energy cleansing sessions.</p><p>In 2016, The Fader described her as a "skilled healer" known for her "incredibly real" astrological insights, and Refinery29 published her astrological tips for career success. On the day of the tragedy, she had over 103,000 followers on X.</p><p>So far, Los Angeles police have not shared much information about Ayoka's motives. Homicide chief, <strong>Guy Golan</strong>, told reporters that neither she nor her partner had a criminal history.</p><p>Before her death, Ayoka's social media was filled with apocalyptic content and warnings <a href=# id=3d3d2a9b-0145-49c9-835a-c0a22e03e098 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>about the solar eclipse</a>, which astrologers say has great significance for zodiac signs. On April 4, Johnson wrote that the upcoming eclipse would be "the epitome of spiritual warfare" and urged Internet viewers to "pick a side." The next day she wrote, "THE APOCALYPSE HAS COME."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"The only witness to this crime we currently have is a 9-year-old girl," Golan said. "We have very little information except that there was a verbal argument that escalated into violence and ended in tragedy."</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=965c0943-dbc9-43be-be3c-1a372cf6dc2c data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXy4u8yapWavmKR6uK3SZpifqpGesW67xWaqqKSRp3qmr8uip6ydXZm2pr%2BMmp2tnaJiwLWtwZugp59dl7y6stGinKecX6aCtIPHn5s%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-who-was-afraid-of-solar-eclipse-dies-after-stabbing-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwoman-who-was-afraid-of-solar-eclipse-dies-after-stabbing-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwoman-who-was-afraid-of-solar-eclipse-dies-after-stabbing-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwoman-who-was-afraid-of-solar-eclipse-dies-after-stabbing-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-who-was-afraid-of-solar-eclipse-dies-after-stabbing-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-who-was-afraid-of-solar-eclipse-dies-after-stabbing-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./american-football.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./american-football.html>Chicago Bears History - On This Day</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emergency-calls-in-germany.html>Making Emergency Calls: Calling 911 in Germany and the EU</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emergency-calls-in-germany.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
