In 1907, a few months before his fiftieth birthday—and terrified of growing older—Freud wrote in his book, On Psychotherapy: “About the age of fifty, the elasticity of the mental processes upon which treatment depends, is, as a rule lacking. Old people are no longer educable.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Freud believed that anyone over fifty was so beyond their sell-by-date that even therapy was impossible. This is the origin of the long slow rot theory. It’s also why we believe that you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet nothing could be farther from the truth. You want proof? For starters, Freud wrote a number of his most important books in his fifties and sixties.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like many myths, Freud’s statement contains a sliver of truth and a slather of blather. While our mental and physical skills decline over time, it turns out that most (and possibly all) of them are use-it-or-lose-it skills. This means, if &nbsp;we never stop using these skills, we get to hang onto them— and even advance them—far later in life than anyone thought possible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Take VO2 Max, which measures the upper-range of our aerobic capacity. If you run stairs, it’s your VO2 Max that determines for how long.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">VO2 Max starts to sag in our twenties and falls off a cliff after fifty. For years scientists believed there was nothing we could do about this situation. But then marathoners and triathletes and ultra-runners—in their sixties, seventies and eighties—began to post times that shouldn’t have been possible. So researchers decided to take a closer look at elite octogenarian athletes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They discovered that proper training erased fifty years of decline. The VO2 Max of athletic eighty-year-olds was equal to that of healthy thirty-five year-olds. More critically, many of our physical skills work the same way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Strength is another example. Muscle fibers begin to decline in number once we reach the age of fifty, but—if properly trained—those lost muscle fibers are buffered by the overdevelopment of the remaining fibers or, as University of Michigan physiologist John Faulkner wrote in a 2008 meta-analysis of the issue: “Even with major losses in physical capacity and muscle mass, the performance of elite and masters athletes is remarkable.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The same holds true for our cognitive skills. Consider “cognitive control,” which is a catch-all term for things like working memory, task switching, multitasking and inhibitory control—or our ability to resist distraction. A great many of the mental deficits that accompany aging result from a decline in cognitive control. Yet, once again, this decline is optional, or as neuroscientists Theodore Zanto and Adam Gazzaley explained in a recent <a href=#>review article</a>: “Fortunately, the brain remains plastic throughout the lifespan, and many age-related declines in cognitive control may be reversed though physical and cognitive training.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it comes to how the brain changes over time, the news isn’t all bad. In fact, research now shows that our later years are a new stage of adult development, where three profound and positive changes take place in the brain.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">First, certain genes activate only by experience, which means the brain remodels itself over time, adding depth and wisdom to our personalities.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Second, the brain learns to recruit regions underutilized in our earlier years, and this can help compensate for the cognitive decline that comes with age. Put differently, when we’re younger, one hemisphere of the brain might be entirely responsible for a particular type of information processing, but as we age, the brain recruits areas in the other hemisphere, which is a kind of neural redundancy that can offset age-related decline.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Third, the brain’s information processing capacities reach their greatest density and height between ages sixty and eighty, allowing the two hemispheres of the brain to work together like never before.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These neurobiological changes unlock three types of thinking that are mostly inaccessible before our fifties.</p><ul class="list-inside pl-10 self-baseline font-pt-serif text-17px tracking-0.5px list-disc"><li><span>Relativistic Thinking: We learn to better synthesize disparate views. We learn that there are few absolute truths, mostly relative truths, and that black-and-white thinking is a folly of youth.</span></li></ul><ul class="list-inside pl-10 self-baseline font-pt-serif text-17px tracking-0.5px list-disc"><li><span>Non-Dualistic Thinking: We learn to consider opposing views without judgment. We learn to see both sides of the same coin. We learn empathy.</span></li></ul><ul class="list-inside pl-10 self-baseline font-pt-serif text-17px tracking-0.5px list-disc"><li><span>Systematic Thinking: We learn to think big picture. We learn how to see the forest through the trees. We learn to think divergently.</span></li></ul><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As we onboard these new thinking styles, they have an even greater impact, unlocking whole new levels of intelligence, creativity, empathy and wisdom—which are all skills essential for thriving today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All of this work has changed the conversation around aging and performance. It’s no longer a question of what we can do in spite of our age. Now, it’s about what we can do because of our age. As pioneering geriatric psychologist Gene Cohen explained in <a href=#>The Mature Mind</a>, his classic book on the subject: “Dozens of new [neurological] findings are overturning the notion that ‘you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. It turns out that not only can old dogs learn well, they are actually better at many types of intellectual tasks than young dogs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The final myth worth exploding is the idea that aging is simply a physical process. As Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer once said: “Aging is as much a mental event as a physical process.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the wildest examples of this emerged from the twenty years of data produced by the Ohio Longitudinal Study on Aging and Retirement. When scientists examined the data to determine the relationship between mindset, health and longevity, they found something staggering.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In this study, a positive mindset toward aging—meaning, “I’m excited about the possibilities in the second half of my life, and I believe my best days are ahead of me”—translated into an extra eight years of healthy longevity. Nor is this just a one-off result. This finding shows up again and again, and is now one of the most well-established facts in the field.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The implications? Changing your mindset toward aging has as much impact on longevity as quitting smoking, and more impact than losing weight, even if you’re obese.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And this matters—a lot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you treat people in their later years—including yourself—as if they’re old, slow and decrepit, this has a direct negative impact on their mental and physical well-being. Yale University psychologist Becca Levy discovered that people subjected to negative stereotypes around aging in their twenties, thirties and forties—by the time they reach their sixties—exhibited a thirty percent greater decline in memory than controls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All of this is to say, believing in these myths about aging? Turns out, that actually ages us faster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2BognSDjq2fnmWdrsGpv4yonWaZl567qHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-myths-of-aging.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-myths-of-aging.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-myths-of-aging.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-myths-of-aging.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-myths-of-aging.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-myths-of-aging.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./deaths.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./deaths.html>Famous Deaths on March 19</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-pairs-of-famous-sisters-whove-become-queens-of-the-spotlight-796168.html>10 Pairs of Famous Sisters Whove Become Queens of the Spotlight</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-pairs-of-famous-sisters-whove-become-queens-of-the-spotlight-796168.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
