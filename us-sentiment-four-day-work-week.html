Another <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>recent experiment</a> involving dozens of companies across North America and Europe found that employees did their assigned work much more efficiently in the shortened time frame.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Now, a new Morning Consult study highlights American workers’ optimism about the practice’s stateside potential: 87% of employed U.S. adults said they would be very or somewhat interested in a four-day workweek, and a nearly equal share (82%) said they think the widespread adoption of it in the United States would be successful.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The research also found that remote work policies may impact the four-day workweek’s appeal. While 75% of employed U.S. adults reported being interested in the truncated approach if remote work was allowed “all or nearly all of the time,” this figure dropped to 51% when respondents were presented with the option of “no remote work at all.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Millennials are most enthusiastic about shortening the workweek&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Nearly all millennials (93%) reported interest in a four-day workweek, with two-thirds saying they would be “very interested,” while 85% also said they believe its adoption would be successful. These represent the highest figures among all generations on both accounts.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Data from Morning Consult’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>State of Workers 2023</a> report found that approximately 4 in 5 millennials (79%) said they always, often or sometimes feel too tired after work to enjoy the things they would like to do in their personal lives. As a result, members of the cohort — many of whom are at or near the peak of their careers — place a premium on flexibility in the workplace. More than a third (37%) rated having a “good work-life balance” as a top priority in a job, and a similar amount (34%) said the same of having “flexible hours or work schedules.”&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Baby boomers, in contrast, were the generation least interested in (71%) and confident about the work schedule’s success (74%). Still, no demographic group reported interest and confidence levels below 70%, again pointing to the practice’s widespread popularity.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">However, removing the ability to work remotely dulls the allure of working fewer days per week.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Is remote work more compelling than a four-day workweek?</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Employed U.S. adults’ stated interest in a four-day workweek declined when presented with hypothetical restrictions on the number of days per week they could work remotely, with the drop-off in interest being most severe (-17 percentage points) between having the ability to work remotely one to two days per week and not having the option at all.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Less than half of Gen Z adults (47%), Gen Xers (49%) and baby boomers (42%) said they would be interested in the shortened schedule if their employer never allowed remote work. Millennials’ interest levels also decreased all tested remote work policies, but remained the highest of any generation.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The data highlights remote work’s staying power as a meaningful employer benefit. Our <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>State of Workers 2023</a> report also found that over half of employed U.S. adults still prefer working remotely in some capacity, whether full-time or hybrid. The top-cited reasons for those who do not prefer to work in-person were hesitations over commutes, an unideal work-life balance and feeling uncomfortable working in an office, per the survey. Most of these concerns would not be resolved with a four-day workweek alone. Thus, employers should expect remote work to remain an important bargaining chip in employee negotiations.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Other perks with potential&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Our four-day workweek survey also asked whether American companies should adopt certain work norms seen in Europe. Large majorities of employed U.S. adults responded in favor of every tested policy, though support was strongest for extended vacation periods and lunch breaks.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There seems to be growing demand, especially among young people, for low-impact lifestyles. TikTok videos about <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>“lazy girl jobs</a>” —&nbsp; described by users as gigs that can be done mostly from home, have flexible schedules that allow for midday dog walks or errands and require no overtime while still offering a liveable salary — have generated millions of views. Similar trends like #BareMinimumMondays or #ActYourWage,&nbsp; encouraging users to do the least work required to perform their jobs adequately, have gone <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>viral.</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While such behavior may seem silly or fleeting, content of this ilk has been around for years. And with that many eyeballs paying attention, it’s likely having some influence on work expectations.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Fo(ur) for thought</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>handful</a> of U.S. companies have already adopted the four-day workweek. In recent months, legislation to shorten the legal workweek has also been <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>introduced</a> in New York, California and the U.S. Congress.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While not imperative for employee attraction and retention, implementing four-day workweeks or similar sensitive-of-personal-time initiatives can be a meaningful way to show employees that their work-life balance matters. Companies that do so sooner rather than later will likely enjoy happier employees, along with the benefit of earning goodwill among a public hungry for these moves from corporate America.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6rAbr%2FEp6uipZWjwW6yzq6pZpyRrnq4u9GkZLCdlaA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fus-sentiment-four-day-work-week.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fus-sentiment-four-day-work-week.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fus-sentiment-four-day-work-week.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fus-sentiment-four-day-work-week.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fus-sentiment-four-day-work-week.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fus-sentiment-four-day-work-week.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./42948-yougov-sleep-study-part-five-dreaming.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./42948-yougov-sleep-study-part-five-dreaming.html>The YouGov Sleep Study: Part Five - On dreaming</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./le-poitou-charentes-et-la-bourgogne-se-lancent-leur-tour-dans-le-soutien-la-librairie.html>Le Poitou-Charentes et la Bourgogne se lancent leur tour dans le soutien la librairie</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./le-poitou-charentes-et-la-bourgogne-se-lancent-leur-tour-dans-le-soutien-la-librairie.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
