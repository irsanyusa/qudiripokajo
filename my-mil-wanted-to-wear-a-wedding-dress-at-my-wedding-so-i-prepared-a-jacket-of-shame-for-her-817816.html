But there are people who seem to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;vile plan to&nbsp;ruin it&nbsp;at&nbsp;any cost. The same happened to&nbsp;one woman, who wrote her story on&nbsp;Reddit. Her MIL wanted to&nbsp;wear white on&nbsp;her wedding day, but the bride decided to&nbsp;punish her for being absolutely deaf to&nbsp;multiple requests to&nbsp;wear any color but white.</p><p><h2>The woman treated her wedding preparations extremely seriously.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d40/8da/199ccd5c0aaf10e2ca9c42d8e3.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 23, has come to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;tell her absolutely mind-boggling <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, and she did need some opinions from the users. She began her post, saying, «Hi&nbsp;everyone, I’ve been following the pod for quite some time, and lately it&nbsp;got me&nbsp;thinking if&nbsp;I might have been inappropriate in&nbsp;this situation as&nbsp;I’m STILL getting shade from this 1&nbsp;year later. So&nbsp;let me&nbsp;know!»</p><p>She continues, writing, «I&nbsp;and my&nbsp;husband got married last year in&nbsp;March after dating for 3&nbsp;years. I’ve never had any issues with his family, and his mother and&nbsp;I used to&nbsp;get along quite well. We&nbsp;are also the first on&nbsp;both sides to&nbsp;get married.»</p><p>She took all wedding preparations with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;responsibility and didn’t want a&nbsp;single detail to&nbsp;go&nbsp;wrong. The woman says, «Long story short, planning this wedding was no&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;the park and there were multiple fights between myself and the mothers (my&nbsp;mother and his mother) about niti gritting decor, what table&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;use, round or&nbsp;square.»</p><p>But she was worried the most about the outfits. She revealed, «Even what style dress&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;wear, but the cherry on&nbsp;the cake was my&nbsp;mother-in-law’s outfit she was planning on&nbsp;wearing!»</p><p><h2>The OP’s MIL was a&nbsp;hard person to&nbsp;deal with, from the very beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/980/13a/627df25697ae5536d37fef2e19.jpg><p>The woman continues her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, saying, that she had some certain preferences regarding the guests’ outfits. She explained, «In&nbsp;the 6&nbsp;months we&nbsp;planned our wedding, I&nbsp;expressed multiple times that the only color guests weren’t allowed to&nbsp;wear was white and even encouraged everyone to&nbsp;go&nbsp;all out with their outfits (prom looks etc. because who doesn’t love dressing up&nbsp;and looking their best), but clearly this didn’t include my&nbsp;mother-in-law.»</p><p>The mom of&nbsp;her husband simply refused to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;what her DIL was telling her. The OP&nbsp;revealed, «She continued to&nbsp;show me&nbsp;pictures of&nbsp;the outfits she was planning on&nbsp;wearing&nbsp;— all of&nbsp;which were completely white.»</p><p>The bride-to-be didn’t want to&nbsp;provoke a&nbsp;scandal, so&nbsp;she used all her diplomatic skills to&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;it. She says, «I&nbsp;tried multiple angles with her. First trying to&nbsp;nudge her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different color direction, then casually bringing up&nbsp;the no&nbsp;white rule. I&nbsp;even asked my&nbsp;husband and mother to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;her about not wearing white, as&nbsp;my&nbsp;direct approach didn’t seem to&nbsp;work (telling her straight up&nbsp;to&nbsp;not. wear. white.)»</p><p><h2>The bride had a&nbsp;plan on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;teach her MIL&nbsp;a good lesson.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ba/ff4/fcd38454d9b891d00be1a0fd7e.jpg><p>The woman goes on&nbsp;with her post, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «The moment&nbsp;I realized&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious plan fast was when one of&nbsp;her online orders arrived, and&nbsp;I just happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there. Finally, I&nbsp;got to&nbsp;see this outfit and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, I&nbsp;prepared myself for the obvious&nbsp;— that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;white and even consider letting the whole white thing slide with her just to&nbsp;spear myself the mental strain.»</p><p>But the most shocking revelation was still ahead. The frustrated woman continues, saying, «But I&nbsp;NEVER thought she would order <strong>a&nbsp;literal wedding dress!</strong> THANK GOODNESS it&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;those Expectation vs&nbsp;Really moments and the dress quality was terrible and went straight to&nbsp;the trash!»</p><p>And then, the&nbsp;OP had an&nbsp;idea on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make her MIL listen to&nbsp;her. She revealed, «Now to&nbsp;what&nbsp;I thought was an&nbsp;excellent plan. After venting to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister and other brides maids about the whole situation, I&nbsp;suggested that there should be&nbsp;some kind of&nbsp;punishment for guests (aka. Mother-in-law) should they show up&nbsp;in&nbsp;white...and so&nbsp;the ’jacket of&nbsp;shame’ idea started.»</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;“Jacket of&nbsp;shame” was the bride’s punishment to&nbsp;everyone who would wear white.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c0/02e/c1302b5ba79a33b9cc2a4f5799.jpg><p>The woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «My&nbsp;sister helped me&nbsp;shop for the perfect jacket. A&nbsp;yellow reflective jacket you usually see construction workers wear. But the fun didn’t stop there!»</p><p>They decorated this jacket in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very special way. The woman explained, «To&nbsp;make sure everyone was aware of&nbsp;the consequences, my&nbsp;sister helped me&nbsp;set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;decorating station at&nbsp;my&nbsp;bridal shower to&nbsp;decorate this ’Jacket of&nbsp;Shame’, and it&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite the hit! My&nbsp;friends and family members enjoyed using glitter pens and colorful sharpies to&nbsp;give the jacket it’s shame by&nbsp;writing things like: ’How dare you show up&nbsp;in&nbsp;white,’ ’Are you the bride? I. THINK. NOT.’»</p><p><h2>The result of&nbsp;the plan surpassed the OP’s expectations.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/650/3a6/99a47f5da1b9907fb2f355e812.jpg><p>The woman goes&nbsp;on, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «Afterwards I&nbsp;explained what the jacket would be&nbsp;used for, that if&nbsp;someone shows up&nbsp;at&nbsp;our wedding wearing white or&nbsp;anything that can be&nbsp;passed off as&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding dress will be&nbsp;forced to&nbsp;wear this Jacket the moment they step onto the venue and that the Jacket won’t be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken off&nbsp;— EVEN in&nbsp;official wedding/family photos.»</p><p>She also added, «Maybe I&nbsp;took it&nbsp;too far after someone asked ’But won’t that ruin your photos and throw off the whole aesthetic?’ and&nbsp;I bluntly replied with ’Not at&nbsp;all! I&nbsp;would frame the photo and hang it&nbsp;up&nbsp;in&nbsp;our house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder/trophy.’»</p><p>But the result was even more than she had expected. The woman revealed, «Needless to&nbsp;say, I&nbsp;never got that photo and mother-in-law turned up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;all black funeral outfit to&nbsp;our wedding. I&nbsp;took it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;win, but&nbsp;I keep getting shade every now and then from his mother and aunt about how inappropriate the Jacket was and that&nbsp;I was such a&nbsp;bad woman for forcing the Jacket onto my&nbsp;guests.»</p><p><h2>People of&nbsp;Reddit were quite supportive about the woman’s plan.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf1/b18/2231af5f06be96a842d86e0fd2.jpg><p>People came to&nbsp;the comments to&nbsp;mainly support and praise the woman.</p><p>One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «MIL was doing a&nbsp;major pout as&nbsp;she was planning to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;white wedding dress and wasn’t confident that she wouldn’t be&nbsp;forced into the jacket of&nbsp;shame. She lost control, and her daughter-in-law had the power. Let’s face&nbsp;it, the wedding dress was a&nbsp;power move that she lost.»</p><p>Some other user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, «Getting really tired of&nbsp;these emotional scenarios where mothers insist on&nbsp;looking like a&nbsp;bride at&nbsp;their son’s wedding. Even worse that she decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for funeral clothes instead as&nbsp;if&nbsp;mourning the death of&nbsp;her relationship with her son’s band to&nbsp;be. I’ll never understand women who loathe other women&nbsp;SO much that the idea of&nbsp;their son getting married is&nbsp;world-ending.»</p><p>And another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a>, «It&nbsp;always seems creepy to&nbsp;me&nbsp;when mothers try to&nbsp;outshine the bride, regardless of&nbsp;which of&nbsp;the spouses-to-be they popped out, and regardless of&nbsp;whether they’re doing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;white or&nbsp;any other color.»</p><p>And here’s yet another <a href=#>epic wedding story</a> from a&nbsp;woman, who was humiliated by&nbsp;her own husband on&nbsp;their wedding day. But she made him a&nbsp;payback that he&nbsp;probably won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;forget soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecyio2avkaPBprCMraZmr5WWv26tjLCcnZyZo7RusNGeqqxlkal6rsWMsJydnJmjtG6%2FzmagZqiimr2ivsSdZJplmpawrLHTZqafZaOdrq6xjJ%2Bmq2WYmr9uhJBwb2puXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-mil-wanted-to-wear-a-wedding-dress-at-my-wedding-so-i-prepared-a-jacket-of-shame-for-her-817816.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmy-mil-wanted-to-wear-a-wedding-dress-at-my-wedding-so-i-prepared-a-jacket-of-shame-for-her-817816.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmy-mil-wanted-to-wear-a-wedding-dress-at-my-wedding-so-i-prepared-a-jacket-of-shame-for-her-817816.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmy-mil-wanted-to-wear-a-wedding-dress-at-my-wedding-so-i-prepared-a-jacket-of-shame-for-her-817816.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-mil-wanted-to-wear-a-wedding-dress-at-my-wedding-so-i-prepared-a-jacket-of-shame-for-her-817816.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-mil-wanted-to-wear-a-wedding-dress-at-my-wedding-so-i-prepared-a-jacket-of-shame-for-her-817816.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elections-lappel-du-parlement-rural-francais-aux-candidats.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elections-lappel-du-parlement-rural-francais-aux-candidats.html>l'appel du Parlement rural franais aux candidats</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./le-transport-fluvial-retrouve-de-lattrait.html>Le transport fluvial retrouve de l'attrait</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./le-transport-fluvial-retrouve-de-lattrait.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
