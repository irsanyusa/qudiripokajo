The David whose job he is after – Lord Cameron – is far more well-known, and far less well-liked: 66% have a negative opinion of the foreign secretary, compared to 21% with a favourable view, for a net score of -45.</p><p data-block-key=733eg>Prominent Conservatives who are tipped to be successors to Rishi Sunak are all received with various degrees of negativity: -15 for Penny Mordaunt, -23 for Kemi Badenoch (who is unknown to 56% of Britons) and -43 for Suella Braverman. Of the three, Mordaunt is the only one who is more popular than not among 2019 Conservative voters (43% like her compared to 25% who do not).</p><p data-block-key=9vue3>Elsewhere, George Galloway, who returned to Parliament after a nine year hiatus following the Rochdale by-election in February, is seen favourably by just 7% of Britons, compared to 60% with an unfavourable view (a net score of -53).</p><p data-block-key=dism6>The new Scottish first minister – John Swinney – is unsurprisingly obscure to most Britons, with 67% not having a view on him. Overall, 9% have a favourable view of the SNP leader and 24% an unfavourable one (net -15) – <a href=#>a recent YouGov poll of Scots</a> showed that he was popular with 35% north of the border and unpopular with 38% (net -3).</p><p data-block-key=9478n>Opinion of the Conservative party largely matches that towards its leader (-49 net score) while the Labour party is somewhat less unpopular than Starmer (-5).</p><p data-block-key=bdu2d>This month’s tracker rotation also includes opinion towards other major parties, namely the Lib Dems, Greens and Reform UK. The figures show that just as few people have a positive impression of Reform UK as the Tories – both on 20% – although Britons are likely to say they dislike Reform UK (48%) because they are more likely to answer “don’t know”, giving them a less negative net score of -28.</p><p data-block-key=c3pgv>Similarly, as many people say they like the Greens as do Labour, at 42%. However, because fewer people are likely to say they dislike them – 37%, again because they are more likely to answer “don’t know” – the Greens are the only party with a positive net favourability rating (+5). On those occasions where we have asked about attitudes towards the Greens, we have consistently found them on top of the party pile, including in studies in <a href=#>2021</a> and <a href=#>2018</a>.</p><p data-block-key=6o0ba>The Liberal Democrats prove popular with a third (33%) and unpopular with 47% – figures which are roughly identical with the last time we asked about the party in 2022.</p><p data-block-key=evt2p><a href=#><b><i>See the full results for our latest favourability figures here</i></b></a></p><h3 data-block-key=hla3s id=leader-attributes>Leader attributes</h3><p data-block-key=94eub>On a personal level, Rishi Sunak performs poorly across the five attributes we track: 54-62% see him as variously incompetent, untrustworthy, weak, dislikeable and indecisive. In the case of the first four, this is either the highest or joint highest score he has recorded on these measures. Only 21-27% believe he embodies the positive counterparts on this list.</p><p data-block-key=c4qqn>Meanwhile Keir Starmer has been keen to present himself as a competent politician, and it this characteristic on which he maintains the most positive score. Slightly more than one in three Britons (37%) say they see Starmer as competent, although almost as many consider him incompetent (34%).</p><p data-block-key=2e36o>Nevertheless, when it comes to the other four measures, negative opinions significantly outnumber positive ones. Between 26% and 29% see him as likeable, decisive, trustworthy and strong – 43-47% hold the opposing views.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Starmer_and_Sunak_attributes_May_2024-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-block-key=eqr8p>Even among those who backed his party in 2019, Sunak does not perform well. Tory voters from five years ago see him as weak (55%) rather than strong (25%) and indecisive (51%) rather than decisive (36%). They are divided 38% to 37% on whether he is trustworthy or note, although he is holding on to a positive competent score for the time being (46%, compared to 36% who see him as incompetent).</p><p data-block-key=cdes0>Keir Starmer, by contrast, continues to be seen favourably by Labour 2019 voters.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Leader_attributes_net_by_2019_vote-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-block-key=70r3l><b><i>See the latest trackers on attributes for</i></b> <a href=#><b><i>Rishi Sunak</i></b></a><b><i> and</i></b> <a href=#><b><i>Keir Starmer</i></b></a></p><h3 data-block-key=a0jkd>Expected election outcome</h3><p data-block-key=4f61o>While Keir Starmer’s ratings among the public may be mediocre, this does not seem to be unduly damping expectations that he will be the next prime minister.

Younger generations are more likely to say the economy is important to them than older age groups: more than half of those aged 25-49 (58%) cite it as a top issue, while just 38% of those 65+ do so.</p><p data-block-key=4r6j>Health is a close second on the most important issues list (44%), followed by immigration (41%). While the economy is cited by similar numbers of 2019 Conservative and Labour voters as an issue, health and immigration are substantially different. Most Labour voters (57%) consider health a top issue while only 39% of Tories say the same; when it comes to immigration, only 20% of Labour voters say it is one of the most pressing national concerns compared to 65% of Conservatives.</p><p data-block-key=1qpvv>These three issues are by far the ones that Britons are most likely to list.

While this is the highest figure since March 2022, the large majority (69%) still disapprove of the government’s economic management.</p><p data-block-key=bvglr>On the connected issue of inflation, 29% say the government is now doing a good job (the highest since September 2021), although again, this is far behind the 62% who think the government is doing a poor job.</p><p data-block-key=e7ub1>That said, recent weeks have seen noticeable improvement in the mood of 2019 Conservatives towards the government’s handling of economic issues. Half (54%) now say the government is handling inflation well, compared to 39% who still say they are handling it badly – in mid-March opinion had been the opposite.</p><p data-block-key=4pe6u>Figures from last week were also the first time the number of 2019 Tories with a positive opinion of the government’s handling of the economy in general (50%) has been higher than those with a negative view (46%) since spring 2022.
