When you are not real, just one sincere question will unsettle you. But if you must avoid nervousness, you must:<ul><li>Be sure of what you feel and slam the consequences (it is not a crime to feel that way and express it)</li><li>Be willing to accept any response (good or bad). You will be relaxed if you are ready for any answers.</li><li>Avoid anxiety as you approach.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39810c81fa79c47d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funny quotes to lighten the mood for when the going gets tough</span></p></a><h3>How to talk to girls online</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/240f19194fa07159.jpg><p class=align-left>Feel comfortable enough before talking to a girl online. After checking her posts and tags, it is easy to find a topic she would be interested in. Pay more attention to details. For example, instead of "music," talk about how she "plays the classical guitar." Below are <a href=#>tips for chanting</a> with a girl online:</p><ul><li>Make a good impression by minding things you post online. Ladies analyze your profile and posts to figure out your personality and lifestyle before responding to your posts. Therefore, post a few things about yourself and avoid obscene pictures and other nasty things.</li><li>Like and comment under her pictures and posts randomly so that she notices you before you slide into her inbox.</li><li>Inbox her with a joke or <a href=#>funny pick-up line </a>and ask if it is a good time for her to chat.</li><li>If she confirms she had time to chat, introduce yourself.</li><li>Complement some of her posts or photos. You can flirt a bit but use respectful language.</li><li>Ask her name and complement it e.g. Jane is a <a href=#>beautiful name</a>.</li><li>Use her posts and pictures to strike conversations like her studies, dream career, songs on her playlist, places she has traveled to, her<a href=#> dream destination</a>, etc.</li><li>Send her photos of interesting places you have been to or places you love spending time. She will trust you more if your current photos prove you are not using a pseudo account.</li><li>Keep the conversation positive. Don't complain about your day, job, family, etc., especially financial issues.</li><li>Don't ask her for photos, especially not naked ones. It is the biggest turn-off for a mature girl.</li><li>Notice more than her creativity, intellect, hobbies, and other things that can help you plan an exciting date for her.</li><li>Send spontaneous but friendly morning and <a href=#>goodnight texts</a>. Do not be too romantic till you meet her. She might assume you are obsessed with her.</li><li>Do not send her many messages every time, especially if she does not respond immediately, because she will think you are clingy.</li><li>Pay attention to how long your conversations last. If the chats last for hours, she likes you enough to want to meet you.</li><li>Show you are serious about her by asking her out at a public place between 8 am and 4 pm to show you care about her safety and security.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3c97821d423923f8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best touching love messages to make him cry long distance</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Hope you have learned something about how to chat with a girl you like from this article.
