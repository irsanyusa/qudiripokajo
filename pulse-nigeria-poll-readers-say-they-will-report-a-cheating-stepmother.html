I live with my father and stepmother in Lagos. My parents separated when I was 15 and and my father got married to a Yoruba woman who has two children for him.</p><p>Before they got married, my stepmother had been divorced twice with five other children. Since I was their only child, I alternated my holidays between both parents but I preferred staying with my dad because he is the kind of father who makes out time to be with his kids and makes sure we get the best of life.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But my stepmother is a different kettle of fish. Though she carries out her duties as a mother, she is the type that keeps the limit and makes sure I do not cross it.</p><p>However, one thing I noticed with her even when I was young was that she loved parties and going out, especially when dad was out of town which was often.</p><p>At such times, she would claim she had to visit to visit her parents in her hometown and could spend up to a week and would only come back a day before dad arrived.</p><p>She would then warn us of serious consequences if we dared tell him she was not home all the time he was away.</p><p>Though the rumours were rife, I never suspected anything until two months ago when my boyfriend visited me from Port Harcourt and lodged at a guest house in Lekki.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I would go to spend time with him but always went back home because dad would skin me raw if I spent the night outside. On the day I saw my stepmother in the guest house, I had gone early to see my boyfriend because he was leaving that day.</p><p>I got to the guest house at about 7am and as I was walking in, lo and behold, I saw my stepmother walking out of a room with a man who used to frequent our house, especially when dad was not in town.</p><p>She had introduced him as her uncle but the way I saw them, there was no doubt they had spent the night together because the day before, she had told us she was going for one of her late uncle's remembrance.</p><p>Luckily, she did not see me as she was all over the man, hugging and kissing him as they walked out into his car.</p><p>I told my boyfriend what I saw but he warned me never to tell my dad but it pains me that though father has been a good husband, his wife still decides to cheat on him.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>My head says I should tell him what I saw but my heart warns that it could be a recipe for disaster, both for the family and myself.</p><p>What should I do?</p><p>The teaser for the day was:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>How Nigeria voted:</p><p>Yes, I will tell him - 57%</p><p>No, I will not be the one to break their marriage - 21%</p><p>I will warn her not to repeat such again - 23%</p><p>What she does with her life is none of my business - 10%</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>How would you vote here?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02inrqSjmnqvtcaeqaKZXaW8rbiMq5yanJWnwG6%2FwLJkraCVrnq4tculZKudoKS%2FtXnAZpqhnZGptq%2BzjKyrnqidpMGpsdFobadvZK%2FHtw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpulse-nigeria-poll-readers-say-they-will-report-a-cheating-stepmother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpulse-nigeria-poll-readers-say-they-will-report-a-cheating-stepmother.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpulse-nigeria-poll-readers-say-they-will-report-a-cheating-stepmother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpulse-nigeria-poll-readers-say-they-will-report-a-cheating-stepmother.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpulse-nigeria-poll-readers-say-they-will-report-a-cheating-stepmother.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpulse-nigeria-poll-readers-say-they-will-report-a-cheating-stepmother.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./warner-bros-discovery-vera-peltekian-mythomaniac-of-the-bataclan-1235570244.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./warner-bros-discovery-vera-peltekian-mythomaniac-of-the-bataclan-1235570244.html></a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./meet-drake-milligan-agt-season-17s-rising-country-music-star.html>Meet Drake Milligan, 'AGT' Season 17's Rising Country Music Star</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./meet-drake-milligan-agt-season-17s-rising-country-music-star.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
