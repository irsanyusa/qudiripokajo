Notable authors like <a href=#>Sloane Crosley</a>, <a href=#>Tommy Orange</a>, and <a href=#>Leslie Jamison</a> return with releases that are considered some of the <a href=#>most anticipated of the year</a>. And poets DéLana R. A. Dameron and Phillip B.

The Canadian author known for experimentation started this reconstruction project in earnest in 2014 in hopes of identifying patterns and preoccupations in her personal writing. She believed that by loading 500,000 words from her old journals into an Excel spreadsheet and putting them in alphabetical order, she might be able to see herself in a new way. After making edits and cuts, Heti told the <a href=#>New York Times</a> in 2022 that her latest release blurs the line between fact and fiction. Whether it should be considered a memoir or something else entirely, Alphabetical Diaries looks at how we see ourselves and how we’d like to be seen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Alphabetical Diaries on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Get the Picture, Bianca Bosker (Feb. 6)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GetThePicture.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seven years after award-winning journalist Bianca Bosker released <a href=#>Cork Dork</a>, her expertly reported deep dive into the wine business, she’s back with Get the Picture, a gripping and often hilarious investigation into the art world. To understand the inner workings of the fine art scene, Bosker goes full Tom Wofe and embeds herself within the community. She stretches canvas until her fingers are raw while interning at a downtown New York City gallery, schmoozes with billionaire collectors at Art Basel Miami, guards master works at the Guggenheim, and lets performance artist and “ass influencer” Mandy allFIRE sit on her face. It’s through these outrageous experiences that Bosker learns to cultivate her artistic “eye” and appreciate the beauty that surrounds her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Get the Picture on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How to Live Free in a Dangerous World, Shayla Lawson (Feb. 6)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HowToLiveFreeInADangerousWorld.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Shayla Lawson’s How To Live Free in a Dangerous World is Eat, Pray, Love for a new generation. In 2021, Lawson was diagnosed with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that causes chronic pain. With hope and humor, they explore how their race, gender identity, and disability affect how they see the world and how the world sees them. It is by traveling to Indiana and Italy, and countless locales in between, that they begin to rethink their sexuality, identity, and mortality. How to Live Free in a Dangerous World is a poignant look at how Lawson learned to liberate themselves from the things that held them back.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now:</strong> How to Live Free in a Dangerous World on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Redwood Court, DéLana R.

A. Dameron's tender debut novel, Redwood Court, follows a teenage girl in the 1990s. As the baby of her family, Mika Tabor has spent much of her life in the house on the titular cul-de-sac in an all-Black middle class neighborhood in Columbia, S.C. There, she grew up listening to her grandparents and parents’ stories of making it in the United States. Her family’s triumphs and struggles become her guide to navigating racism, sexism, and poverty as she comes of age at the start of a new millennium. Dameron is a native of Columbia—and her knowledge of the community shines through this portrait of a Southern Black family doing all they can to hold on to the American dream.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Redwood Court on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Book of Love, Kelly Link (Feb. 13)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/TheBookOfLove.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pulitzer Prize finalist and short story master <a href=#>Kelly Link</a>’s long awaited debut novel, The Book of Love, begins with best friends Laura, Daniel, and Mo realizing that they’ve been dead for nearly a year.

With each new challenge, the three get closer to solving the mystery of their deaths and reclaiming the lives they left behind. As it becomes clear that there are darker forces at play, The Book of Love turns into a heart-wrenching exploration of love and loss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: The Book of Love on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Fox Wife, Yangsze Choo (Feb. 13)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/TheFoxWife.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inspired by Chinese and Japanese folklore, Yangsze Choo’s The Fox Wife follows a hard-boiled private detective named Bao who is tasked with uncovering the identity of a woman found dead in an alleyway in 1900s Manchuria. His investigation soon leads him to Snow, a mom seeking vengeance for her daughter, who also happens to be a shape-shifting fox.

The celebrated Indian author first became interested in the addictive drug’s impact on the world while writing his ambitious Ibis trilogy, a series of historical novels set in the years leading up to the First Opium War, a conflict between Britain and Imperial China over the opium trade. With exquisite prose and thorough reporting, Ghosh lays out how the narcotic secretly built some of the world’s biggest corporations and reveals his own family’s connection to the “opium-industrial complex.” By laying out the parallels between the early opium epidemic in 19th century China and the current opioid crisis in the U.S., Smoke and Ashes offers a sobering reminder of how history is doomed to repeat itself when we choose to forget it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Smoke and Ashes on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Ours, Phillip B.

Williams’s transcendent debut novel Ours is a surreal saga set in the antebellum South that looks at the complex nature of freedom. After a conjurer named Saint brings destruction to the plantations of Arkansas, she creates a safe haven for formerly enslaved people and their families located just north of St. Louis. For decades, Saint is able to protect the community from the evils of the world, but soon the people living there begin to worry that they’re experiencing a different kind of subjugation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now:</strong> Ours on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Splinters, Leslie Jamison (Feb. 20)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Splinters.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Leslie Jamison’s new memoir, Splinters, offers a candid and perceptive look at divorce, motherhood, and personal reinvention.

With unbridled vulnerability, she writes of being a child of divorce, the challenges of dating as a single mom, and the overwhelming nature of juggling childcare and working.

With compassion and rage, she wrestles with the root causes of the ongoing eating disorder epidemic in the U.S., which has seen an uptick in anorexia, bulimia, and disordered eating among young women <a href=#>in recent decades</a>. Across 12 deeply researched essays, she calls out Kim Kardashian for “impl[ying] the customer’s natural form is a problem to be solved” with her influential company SKIMS, and analyzes the role pro-eating disorder content on social media plays in the current crisis.

(To top it all off, six months later, the COVID-19 pandemic would leave the whole world in mourning.) Crosley’s debut memoir, Grief Is For People, is a sardonic and lyrical meditation on grief and a mournful eulogy for a complicated friend that offers a powerful lesson in how to navigate life’s most painful moments with humor and grace.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Grief Is For People on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Wandering Stars, Tommy Orange (Feb. 27)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/WanderingStars.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Its expansive timeline makes Tommy Orange’s Wandering Stars both a prequel and a sequel to his breakout 2018 debut, <a href=#>There There</a>. And much like its best-selling predecessor, Wandering Stars is a crushing and breathtaking exploration of Indigenous history and identity. With his latest, the Cheyenne and Arapaho author traces the effects the <a href=#>Carlisle Indian Industrial School</a>, an institution dedicated to the eradication of Native history, culture, and identity, has had on three generations of one family. The novel begins with Star, a young survivor of the <a href=#>1864 Sand Creek Massacre</a>, being forced to assimilate, only to pick up 144 years later in Oakland, CA where his descendent, There There protagonist Orvil Red Feather, struggles with addiction and poverty. Wandering Stars is an empathetic look at the cost of generational trauma.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now:</strong> Wandering Stars on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWhuhXOBjpucrKxdl7ywt9JmnZ6aoqqus8WMa2drbF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-books-february-2024.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-books-february-2024.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-books-february-2024.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-books-february-2024.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-books-february-2024.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-books-february-2024.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./best-way-to-learn-spanish.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./best-way-to-learn-spanish.html>The best way to learn Spanish: 10 tips</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tv-personality.html>Jilly Goolden popularity &amp;amp; fame</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tv-personality.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
